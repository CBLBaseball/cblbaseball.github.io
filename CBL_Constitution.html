<h2>3. Penalties</h2>
<p>3A. Penalties for Lateness
For purposes of determining if games or CMs are submitted late, deadlines are defined as 11:59 PM Pacific on the date announced (for instance the CMs for block 1 were due at 11:59 PM on Sat. April 3rd).

3a. Games not turned in by deadlines - For any games not played by the announced deadline, the games will be auto-played by league using the lineups in your CM plus you will be penalized according to the following schedule:</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
<thead><tr><th>Total Blocks Late</th><th>Penalty</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>10th Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>8th Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>4th Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>2nd Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1st Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Roster Spot + 1st Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p>3b. CM(s) not turned in by deadlines - The total days your CMs are submitted late throughout the season will be added together and you will be penalized according to the table below:</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
<thead><tr><th>Total Days Late for all CM Submittals</th><th>Penalty</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Warning</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Warning</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>10th Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>9th Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>7th Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>5th Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>3rd Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>1st Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Roster Spot + 3rd Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Roster Spot + 1st Rd. Draft Pick</td></tr>
<tr><td>11+</td><td>League Sanctions (possible dismissal from league)</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p>For both game lateness and CM lateness penalties, in the event that you do not own the pick you are penalized you will be penalized your next highest pick (either yours or one obtained in a trade). If you do not own your 1st round pick (or one better) you will be penalized a roster spot at the 23-man cut and will not be permitted to claim any rookies. Penalization occurs at the 23-man cut, so any picks obtained up to that point are fair game to satisfy the penalty.

3B. Penalties for Overusage
3a. At the end of the each block any player that has reached their 105% AB/IP usage limit will be declared ineligible for the remainder of the season and will be demoted to the minors. Additionally, at the end of the season the following penalties will be assessed to each team:

AB/IP Overusage (per player)-
up to 105% = No penalty
more than 105% but not over 107% = Player is ineligible for use in the playoffs
more than 107% but not over 110% = Immediate forfeiture of the overused player
more 110% = Immediate forfeiture of the overused player plus forfeiture of a roster spot for the subsequent season

3b. If you have more than 4 players that violate the overusage rules (more than 105% usage) you will be subject to further discipline and possible removal as a manager. REMEMBER, the 5% extra usage is meant to be used as a buffer, when you get up near those limits it is time to seriously consider shutting a guy down or you will have to pay the price if you go beyond that limit.


4A. Playing a CBL series</p>
<p>1) Make sure you have loaded the latest LZP distributed by the league.

2) In the Strat-o-Matic program, select the current CBL league from the main screen and select &quot;New Scheduled...&quot; from the file menu (or click on the associated icon).

3) In the schedule window that pops up, scroll to the first day of the series you intend to play.

4) If you haven&#x27;t already done so, switch the game setting for the game you wish to play from &quot;Hold&quot; to &quot;Manual&quot; by selecting the game and selecting &quot;Manual&quot; from the drop down menu in the upper left corner of the window.

5) Click on the &quot;Play Day&quot; button of the schedule window, then on the &quot;Manual&quot; button of the next window that pops up, this will bring up the Game Setup window.

6) In the Game Setup window, for the 1st game of the series click the &quot;Days Off&quot; button, then the &quot;Yes&quot; button on the warning window that pops up, to make sure there is no pitcher fatigue carried over from a previously played/imported series. DO NOT click on this button for games 2 or 3 of a series as normal SADV pitcher fatigue rules apply.

7) In the Game Setup window, verify that the &quot;Use DH Rule&quot; and &quot;Create Game Result Files&quot; are checked and that the home manager is set to &quot;Computer&quot;

8) Set your lineup as you see fit. Position eligibility does not apply to the road team, so any of your eligible hitters may start at any positions you choose.

9) Make sure you use the starting pitcher you set in your computer manager. You may not switch starting pitchers after you submitted your CM.</p>
<p>10) If a pitcher is both a starter and reliever, he must have 4 days rest before each start, so do not use him in relief if he will be scheduled to start with in the next 5 days. This is hard to control at home, so be extra cautious.</p>
<p>11) Once your lineup is set, click the &quot;Play Ball&quot; button.

12) Enjoy playing your game.

13) Once the final out is recorded, Click on the &quot;Get Boxscore&quot; button of the first pop-up window and &quot;OK&quot; of the second (Subsets) pop-up window.

14) This brings up the boxscore for your completed game, you do not need to save anything as the Boxscore and Play Account files to be submitted are automatically saved, but you may review, print or save the game results as you wish for your own records.

15) Once you are finished reviewing the game stats, click on the &quot;End Game&quot; button to close the window.

16) For games 1 and 2 of a series, return to Step #2 above to move on to the next game of the series (remember to skip Step #6). For game 3 of a series, move on to the steps for compiling and submitting game results.


Compiling and Submitting Results from a CBL series
15) Once a series is completed, open windows explorer and navigate to the &quot;C:\CDROMBB\Print\2010cb&quot; folder (or instead of CDROMBB, the folder where you installed the game)

16) Select the BOX and PAC files from the series you just completed (they will be named &quot;BOX date visiting_team @ home_team&quot; and &quot;PAC date visiting_team @ home_team&quot; for each game played) and add them to a ZIP file. It is important for tracking purposes to use a naming system for the zip file similar to that John selected - for instance for my 1st series, vs. KC, I would use s1SEA@KCA.ZIP, for my second series, vs. Oakland, I would use s2SEA@OAA.ZIP</p>
<p>.

17) Once the ZIP file is created, navigate to the &quot;C:\CDROMBB\Export&quot; folder and select the six game result files from the series you just completed and add them to the ZIP file you created in Step #16. One good method for determining the correct files is by looking at the date created, but I&#x27;ll also give a quick primer on how those files are named below.

18) Once the ZIP file contains the proper files (the BOX, PAC and game result files = 12 files per 3 game series), upload the ZIP file to the proper folder on the Yahoo! group page (http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/CBLSL/files/) and/or email the ZIP file to ME (cblbaseball@charter.net), Kevin (kmgordon8@verizon.net), Josh (jcomfort@gonzaga.edu) and your opponent.

19) Get cracking on your next series. IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLETE ANY PART OF THE ABOVE, YOU HAVE NOT COMPLETED YOUR OBLIGATION FOR THAT SERIES AND IT WILL BE CONSIDERED LATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<section class="doc-section" id="understanding-strat-files">
<h2>UNDERSTANDING STRAT FILES.</h2>
<p>One thing that can slow us down is when someone sends the wrong file and it gets imported, so please read the following to prevent this from happening this year;

Without getting too technical, the game results files use the 8.3 filenaming scheme from the old DOS and early windows operating systems. What this means is that the file names are always 8 characters long (before the period) with a 3 character extension (after the period). An example is &quot;2010cbJ9.v07&quot;.

There are three parts to these file names:
1) the first 6 characters identifies the league associated with the file, &quot;2010cb&quot; in the example above. These are the 6 characters that identifies the 2010 CBL in the Strat program and for the CBL regular season this year all game result file names will begin with thes 6 characters

2) the two characters that directly precede the period (&quot;J9&quot; above) are the one character codes that identify the away (the first of the two characters) and home teams (the second of the two characters). Essentially, each team is assigned a one character code (0 - 9 or A to Z) that represents them in the Strat file naming system for game results. The biggest thing to understanding the file names is knowing which character is assigned to each team. I&#x27;ve listed the key for identifying the 2010 CBL teams is at the end of this email.

3) the three characters after the period indicate whether the file contains data for the home (h) or away team (v) and the number of times the two teams have played based on the current stats in the league. In the example above the &quot;v07&quot; indicates that the file contains data for the away team and that it is the for the 7th game the two teams played against each other. For the 1st series you play against a team the numbers will be 01, 02 and 03 (assuming you don&#x27;t import the stats from the games that team plays against you). After that it will depend on how many games (home and away) you&#x27;ve previously played against the team, but they&#x27;ll always be 3 numbers in sequential order for any given series assuming you don&#x27;t import other stats in the middle of a series.

If this confused you, you can always fall back on using the date created to verify that the game result files are the correct ones. The date created will always match that for the BOX and PAC files from the same game. Shoot me an email if you have any questions.
